An app to chart your daily caffeine consumption.

## About

After reading Why We Sleep, I was shocked to learn that a coffee in the morning could impact your sleep that evening. The calculation for caffeine's half life is pretty straightforward, at around 6 hours unless you are older, heavier or pregnant. However the question of caffeine and sleep becomes trickier if you have multiple caffeinated beverages of different levels at different points during the day. Hopefully this app sheds some light on how much caffeine is remaining in your system at bedtime. 

## Challenges

- Implementing am charts and triggering a refresh with state
- Updating the calculations with each addition to caffeine list
- Working with bootstrap for the first time

## Future Features

- Correlating caffeine intake with your sleep tracker
- Varying the caffeine half-life based on weight and age
- Integrating the drink list with a larger beverage library via API
